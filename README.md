# Reattach Instance (Figma Plugin)
Relink a frame to a component by searching for similar instances.
Useful for when you are trying to copy a nested component.

Get it here: https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/741415678427267506/Reattach-Instance


## How it works:
1. Select a frame (that used to be an instance)
2. Click "Plugin/Reattach instance"
3. The first occurence of an instance with the same name will be duplicated (without overrides)
4. The selected frame is replace by the new instance copy.

## Know problems:
- Ignores overrides
- Relies too much on layer naming
- Need to have an instance as a reference on the same page

Feel free to contribute :)
