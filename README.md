# Reattach Instance (Figma Plugin)
Relink a frame to a component by searching for similar instances.

## Use cases:
- Copying a nested component
- Moving the master component to a different file
- Turning a set of similar frames into a component
- Turning detached instances back into instances

Get it here: https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/741415678427267506/Reattach-Instance


## How it works:
1. Select frames (that used to be instances)
2. Click "Plugin/Reattach instance"
3. Plugin finds instances or master components with the same name
4. New instance is created for each corresponding frame
5. The selected frames are replaced by instances

*NEW:* Overrides will now be applied to instances!

## Known problems:
- Relies too much on layer naming
- Needs to have an instance/master as a reference on the same page

Feel free to contribute :)
